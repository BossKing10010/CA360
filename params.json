I have continued to add to the repository and update the examples, and it is now the repository for all of my Core Animation examples and sample code, whether they are for blog posts, articles or conference presentations.\r\n\r\n## The Slide Decks\r\n\r\nYou can download the slide decks from some of the presentations that feature the examples in this repository on the [downloads page](https://github.com/neror/CA360/downloads).\r\n\r\n## The Author\r\n\r\nHi, I'm Nathan ([@neror](http://twitter.com/neror)). I founded [Free Time Studios](http://www.freetimestudios.com) where we build apps and games for iOS devices.\r\n","tagline":"Core Animation example code for iOS.
